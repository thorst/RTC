Open WebRTC Implementation


Browser Support:

The intention is not to support every browser prefix. It would be to support those who have finished implementing the features. If it turns out that they hold onto the prefixes for a while, I may change my mind.

Currently I'm only targetting Chrome. Specifically the [Dev Branch](http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).

***Technologies:***

Here are a list of some technoligies you should be familiar with prior to editing the project.

*jQuery

*Bootstrap

*Signalr
